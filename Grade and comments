Comments:

1 - Very nice!  Terrific class structure.  Well organized.  Fractions are in the fraction calculator and not in the main.
2 - Nice operations.  They work and you even added some of your own )like mixed number and decimalize).
3 - Comments on your methods would help...remember pre and post conditions, how you did things too.
4 - You write clear code with reasonalbe variable and method names.
